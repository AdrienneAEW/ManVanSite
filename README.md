# ManVanSite
A small website built from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  This respository is more about practicing and learning how to use Git.  Every web development/design position I see seems to ask for Git. Building this site, as I study JavaScript, using Git is a great way for me to practice what I'm learning. Praise God for coders - the best folks on the planet.  You all are so generous.
